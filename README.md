# VotexChain: Decentralized Voting and Verification Platform using Sign Protocol

Idea: VotexChain is a decentralized voting platform designed to bring transparency, security, and trust to elections. By leveraging the Sign Protocol, VotexChain allows users to verify their identity before voting, with each vote recorded on-chain for public verifiability. The platform provides real-time tallying and ensures that all votes are tamper-proof and transparent. Ideal for corporate governance, community decisions, and student elections, VotexChain eliminates the risks of fraud and manipulation.
